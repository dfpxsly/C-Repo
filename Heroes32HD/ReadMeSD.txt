10)   Windows®, Virtual Memory, and Hard Disk Space:

The Windows operating system requires a certain amount of virtual memory 
to function properly. The amount of virtual memory required by Windows 
varies depending on how much of your computer's resources are required by 
an application.  Heroes III: The Shadow of Death, like most other games, 
requires the use of most of your computer's resources to run properly.  
(Therefore, for a Windows application like Heroes III: The Shadow of Death 
to run properly there must be sufficient free space on the hard disk with 
your Windows system folder.)  As a general rule of thumb, you should keep 
enough free hard disk space equal to the larger of: two times the total 
amount of RAM your computer has; or, 10% of the space on the hard drive 
with Windows.

12)   Troubleshooting:

Installation 

Problem: 	
	The CD is in the CD-ROM drive, but the computer is not 
	recognizing it. 
Answers: 	
	The CD may be dirty or scratched.
Solutions: 	
	1. Make sure that the data side of the CD (shiny side) is not 
	dirty or scratched.  If it is dirty, take a lint free 
	non-abrasive cloth and wipe gently to clean it (always wipe from 
	the inside of the CD to the outside edges).  If the data side of 
	the CD appears to be scratched, return the game to the store that
	you bought it from, and exchange it for a new copy. If you are 
	unable to exchange the game at the store that you bought it from,
	please call Customer Support for information on our exchange 
	policy.

Problem:	
	The computer freezes during install, or you receive an error 
	message (such as "*_ins error" or "An error has occurred during 
	the move data process") during install.
Answers: 	
	Your computer may be using an older 16-bit CD-ROM driver; or 
	there may not be enough space on your hard drive for temporary 
	files to expand; or the CD-ROM drive might be having problems 
	with how it buffers information. Or, the Autorun or DMA settings 
	on your CD-ROM drive could be interfering with the game 
	installation.

To check and see if your computer is using an older 16-bit CD-ROM driver:
  1. Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and select 'Properties'.
  2. Click on the 'Performance' tab.
  3. In the Performance status box, if the File System line says  
     "Some drivers are using MS-DOS® compatibility", you are using a 
     16-bit CD-ROM driver.
Solutions:	
  1. For 16-bit CD-ROM drivers: Contact the manufacturer of your 
     CD-ROM drive or the manufacturer of your computer for an updated
     32-bit CD-ROM driver.
  2. For 32-bit CD-ROM drivers:
     1. Close all unnecessary programs running in the 
	Background.  Press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys at the same time
	to open the Close Program window, select a program, and 
	press the End Task button.  Repeat this process until all
	programs except 'Explorer' and 'Systray' are closed.
     2. Delete all files in your C:\Windows\Temp folder, then 
	empty the Recycle Bin.
  3. Turn off read-ahead on the CD-ROM drive:
     1. Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and select 'Properties'.
     2. Click on the 'Performance' tab.
     3. Click on the 'File System' button.
     4. Choose the 'CD-ROM' tab at the top
     5. Change the 'Optimize access pattern for' field to 
        'No read-ahead'
     6. Click on Apply, then OK and finally click Close (you 
        will be prompted to restart your system).
  4. Turn off the Autorun and DMA settings on your CD-ROM drive:
     1. Right click on the 'My Computer' icon and choose 'Properties'.
     2. Click on the 'Device Manager' tab.
     3. Click on the '+' sign next to the CD-ROM line so that it 
        becomes a '-' sign.
     4. Click on the line that appears under the CD-ROM line so that 
        it is highlighted, then click on the 'Properties' button.
     5. Click on the 'Settings' tab.
     6. Look for the Auto-insert Notification and DMA lines.  If there 
	is a check mark in the boxes next to either of these lines, 
	click on the box to remove the check mark.
     7. Click on the 'Apply' button, and then click on the 'OK' 
	button.
     8. When you are asked if you want to restart your system, choose 
	'Yes'. 

You can restore all of the CD-ROM settings back to normal after the game 
has been successfully installed.


Launching the Game I

Problem: 	
	After launching the game from the Start menu or Desktop icon, you
	get a blank screen, a black box that surrounds the mouse cursor, 
	blurring or choppy graphics, vertical lines on the screen, choppy
	sound, or no sound.
Answer: 	
	There is probably a conflict between your video or sound card and
	Microsoft®'s DirectX.
Solution: 
For Windows 95 and 98 users: 
1. Press the 'Start' button on the Windows 95/98-task bar and select 
   'Run'. 
2. Type "dxdiag", or "C:\Progra~1\Directx\Setup\Dxdiag.exe" then 
   click on the 'OK' button. This will run the DirectX Diagnostics Tool.
3. Make sure all your files are DirectX 7.0a compatible. Select the 
   'DirectX Files' tab make sure there are no exclamation points next 
   to the file names. If you find exclamation points under this tab you 
   will need to reinstall DirectX 7.0a by going to the 'START' Button on 
   the Windows95 task bar then select 'RUN' and type your CD-ROM drive
   letter followed by ":\DirectX\dxsetup.exe" and click on the 'Reinstall 
   DirectX' button. This will reinstall DirectX 7.0a.
4. Make sure all of your drivers are DirectX 7.0a compatible. Select the 
  'DirectX Drivers' tab and make sure there are no exclamation points 
   next to any of the file names.  If you find exclamation points under 
   this tab you will need to update your drivers by contacting the 
   manufacturer of the hardware through their Phone Support or through 
   their web site. 3DO has a listing of manufactures sites available at: 
   http://www.3do.com/support.
5. Test your hardware with the DirectX 7.0a Diagnostics tool. Run the tests 
   that are available on the 'Display', 'Sound', and 'Input' tabs. If one
   or more tests fail, this could be due to driver incompatibility. 
   Installing the newest drivers available for your sound and video card 
   hardware can usually resolve this.

For Windows 98 users:
1. Press the Start button on the Windows 98 task bar and select 'Help'
2. Select the Search tab, type 'DirectX Troubleshooter' in the text box, 
   and then press the List Topics button.  Select 'DirectX Troubleshooter'
   in the Topics window, click the Display Button, and then follow the 
   instructions to troubleshoot your DirectX issue.

Launching the Game II

Problem:    
	You try to start the game and the screen flashes briefly, and you
	are returned to the desktop without an error message. 
Answer:       
	There are probably miscellaneous programs running in the 
	background that are interfering with the game and causing it to 
	crash. 
Solution:
	For Windows 95 users:     
1. Press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys at the same time to open the Close Program
   window.
2. Click on a program so that it is highlighted, then click on the 'End 
   Task' button.
3. Repeat this process until only 'Explorer' and 'Systray' are left in 
   the Close Program list, then try running the game.

For Windows 98 users:
1. Click on the Windows Start button, then choose Run.
2. In the Run line type in: "msconfig", then push the 'Enter' key. (This 
   will bring up the System Configuration Utility.)
3. Select the 'Startup' tab, and turn all of the check boxes off, except 
   for the one next to 'Systray'.
4. Press 'OK'. When you are prompted to restart your system, click 'Yes'.
5. Once your machine has restarted try running the program again. 


Other

Problem:
	Large, XL and 3D Mouse cursor doesn't refresh correctly in 
	windowed mode.
Answer:
	Switching to a standard, non-animated mouse cursor will correct
	this problem.
Solution:
For Windows 95 and 98 users:
1. Click on the Windows Start button, then choose settings, then control 
   panel.
2. Double-click on the mouse icon to open the mouse properties control 
   applet.
3. Click on the pointers tab.
4. With the "Normal Select" cursor selected, click "browse" near the 
   bottom of the window.
5. Double-click on a non-animated cursor from the list of cursors in the

Problem:
	If your monitor is not capable of switching to High Color (16-bit) 
	mode, at a resolution of 800x600, the game will fail to launch.
Answer:
	Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Shadow of Death needs to be run 
	in High Color (16-bit) mode, at a resolution of 800x600.

Solution:
1. Right-click on an empty area on your desktop and choose 'Properties' 
   from the menu that appears. 
2. When your Display Properties comes up, go to the Settings tab. Make 
   sure the Desktop Area (Win 95) / Screen Area (Win 98) is set to 800x600 
   or higher. 
3. Under your color settings change your color resolution to 16 bit high 
   color.

If the slider is grayed out and cannot be changed, your monitor may not 
be capable of running at this resolution. There can be two reasons for 
this. First, your monitor may be setup incorrectly under Windows. If 
Windows says that your monitor is a "Standard VGA 640x480" or "Unknown 
Monitor", you should go to your monitor manufacturer's website and 
download the latest driver for your monitor and install it. If you have 
your monitor configured correctly and it still can't run at 800x600 mode, 
then your monitor may not be capable of running at that high of a 
resolution. You may want to consult the monitor's documentation or 
contact it's manufacturer to confirm this. If your monitor cannot switch 
to 800x600 resolution, you will not be able to run the game on it.


Video and Sound card manufacturers regularly update their software 
drivers to enhance performance and stability, and to improve 
compatibility with DirectX.  You can find links to many of these 
manufacturers' sites by going to the Driver Updates section of our 
support web site, which is located at http://www.3do.com/support. 

You may obtain a list of Microsoft-certified video and audio drivers for 
your hardware by going to http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl/.  Drivers 
listed here are confirmed to be compatibility with Windows 95, Windows 98
and Windows NT 4.0. 

Microsoft updates DirectX and its components regularly and posts them for
download off of their web site at http://www.microsoft.com/directX.
